## Description

Master's thesis in research written in the framework of a double master's program between INSA Lyon and Universit√§t Passau. (with honors)

Subject: "Deep Generative Graph model investigation on small-world network".

Investigation on the state of the art of deep graph generators.
Construction of an experimental pipeline to compare the performances of the generation models.
Comparative study between two extremely popular models used in several advanced applications (roadmap generation, code generation, molecular and protein synthesis).
Study of new metrics for measurement evaluation based on the use of graph neural networks.
