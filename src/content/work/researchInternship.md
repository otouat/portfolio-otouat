## Description

Subject : Very low latency audio processing on FPGA by high-level synthesis.
In collaboration with the GRAME staff. Study of a code compiler to C++, in order to produce functional code for synthesis in VHDL via Vivado HLS. Writing of a C++ code wrapper and writing of an English documentation for the research staff.
This research has been published in a paper called "Faust2FPGA for Ultra-Low Audio Latency: Preliminary work in the Syfala project" published in the IFC2020 conference.
